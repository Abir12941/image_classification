## Udacity Deep Learning Foundations Nano-Degree image classification project

This is second project on [DNFND class](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101). In this project, I classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), and I access the [floydhub.com](https://www.floydhub.com) for using GPU on this project.

1. I can get 64.4% accuracy, I know that it is not a high result. Beacause, I use a simple CNN, and over 50% accuracy is not bad. I'll study few more skills about it, then I can get better accuracy than now.
2. The number of epochs, which I set 100, appears excessive. The validation accuracy does not improve beyond 20 epochs, also the likelihood of overfitting is increased. I should tune hyperparameter values variety ways, then the accuracy of validation will be close to 80%.
